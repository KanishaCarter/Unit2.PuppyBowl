# Unit2.PuppyBowl
Block 18 Workshop Pt. 2
Overview
In our upcoming career simulation, we will be developing some features for a web application. As we have learned in this block, it can be extremely useful to have a testing plan for our projects, to make sure that the features we develop are working as expected (or required).

Teams or companies that do not use test driven development may instead choose to define a manual test suite. This is simply a list of steps a tester will take to verify the app or website works as expected, and that edge cases are handled appropriately.

In this exercise, you will get with your learning team, and use the following feature requirements to define a manual test suite. When you get to your career simulation, you will use this test suite to help ensure your site is functionally complete.

You can create this test suite in any way you like, but we recommend using a Google Sheet or Excel spreadsheet. When finished, upload the document to Canvas or submit a link to your shared Google Sheet.

For each requirement or feature, make sure you consider how could a user encounter broken or unexpected behavior depending on their actions!

Do not be afraid to add, remove, or change tests as necessary later, as you begin working on the project and discover new edge cases.

Feature Requirements: Puppy Bowl
Introduction
The Puppy Bowl is a mini-game that allows users to add and remove cute puppies to a game roster. Some of this application has already been finished, but it is important to test "complete" functionality as well, to make sure everything is working for your clients.

Main Page
Should show a nicely formatted list of all players
Each player on the roster should be shown with two buttons:
A "See details" button that lets us view the details for that player. This should show at least:
The player's name, breed, and assigned team (or "unassigned" if they do not have a team)
A larger version of the picture
A button to go back to the main list
See the "Stretch Goals" section for more possible features
A "Remove" button that takes that player off the roster
Adding Player(s)
There should be a form on the page that allows us to add a new player.
The form should have at least two inputs and a button:
One input for the player name
One input for the player's breed
A submit button to send the data and add the player to the roster
See the "Stretch Goals" section for more possible form features.
When entering a name and breed into the form and then hitting "submit", the new player should pop up in the roster without a page refresh.
Removing Player(s)
When removing a player, they should disappear from the roster without a page refresh.
Stretch Goals
Stretch goals are features or functionality that are "nice to have" for an application, but not strict requirements. For the career simulation, consider them extra credit, but we should create test suites for them anyway.

Single Player View:
Show all of the teammates (all players assigned to the same team) as the current player.
Add a dropdown so that users can change the team assignment for the current player.
The team assignment should change in the single player view and in the roster immediately, without a page refresh.
Adding Players:
Add an input to the form which lets us provide an image URL when adding a player.
The linked image should show up as the player's portrait.
Please submit a file or a GitHub link (make sure it is set to public)
